The intention is for this script to be accessed from the Script Menu and
acts on the currently active application. Running the script will toggle
the current window restore state and display a message telling the user
what has happened.  For more information about the Script Menu please

* This script has only been tested on Mac OS X 10.7.1 under US English
and may contain i18n issues which are not accounted for.
